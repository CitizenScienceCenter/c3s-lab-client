Next step is to build around it an initial community of contributors (colleagues, friends, family, and more!) that will allow to test its scope, form, and potentials. By involving all contributors in the co-creation process, a lot can be learned about research questions, process, data, and mutual benefits, before deciding to spend more resources in a full-fledged implementation (ie. developing a project with a unique graphic style, dedicated features, etc. For more info on this option, please contact us).",
